I'm a first-year computer science Ph.D. student at Harvard University in the [Insight + Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu/). Previously, I graduated from Williams College with a B.A. in computer science + cognitive science. I also love art (drawing, painting, graphic design, photography, you name it!) and am constantly looking for interdisciplinary ways to synergize my passions and explore the interaction between emerging technologies and creative expression 💖.

Research Interests: *Human-AI Interaction*, *Interpretability*, *Visualization*

## Fun facts
💻 This summer, I will be interning at Microsoft Research. I have also interned at Adobe Research (2022) and Microsoft Research (2021).

🎉 I was a Grace Hopper Conference Scholar in 2019, attended GHC again in 2020, and spoke at GHC 2021 as an undergraduate finalist in the ACM Student Research Competition!

💬 My undergraduate research focused on AI explainability for learning analytics systems. 
* Check out an interactive applet I made about Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) that involves [American Sign Language](https://catherinesyeh.github.io/bkt-asl/) or [hot air balloons](https://catherinesyeh.github.io/bkt-balloon/) 🎈.

😎 One of my favorite projects I've made is [DigiWeave](https://github.com/catherinesyeh/digiweave/), a programming language that generates friendship bracelet patterns. Try it out with this [demo](https://catherinesyeh.github.io/digidemo/)!
