I'm currently a junior at [Williams College](https://www.williams.edu/), studying computer science + cognitive science. I also love art (drawing, painting, graphic design, photography, you name it!) and am constantly looking for creative ways to combine my passions. I'm particularly inspired by the Google Arts & Culture [experiments](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/arts-culture) 🧪.
