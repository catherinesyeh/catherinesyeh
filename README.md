# Hi! I'm Catherine 👧🏻👋🏼✨
I'm a computer science Ph.D. student at Harvard University in the [Insight + Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu/). Previously, I graduated from Williams College with a B.A. in computer science + cognitive science. I also love art (drawing, painting, graphic design, photography, you name it!) and am constantly looking for interdisciplinary ways to synergize my passions and explore the interaction between emerging technologies and creative expression 💖.

Research Interests: *Visualization*, *Interpretability*, *Human-AI Interaction*
