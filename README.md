I'm currently a senior at [Williams College](https://www.williams.edu/) studying computer science + cognitive science. I also love art (drawing, painting, graphic design, photography, you name it!) and am constantly looking for interdisciplinary ways to synergize my passions and explore the interaction between emerging technologies and creative expression 💖.

Areas of Interest: *AI/ML*, *Human-AI Interaction*, *Intelligence Augmentation*, *Intersections of Technology and Art*, *AR/VR*, *Multimodal Systems*

## Fun facts
💻 Last summer, I interned at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/), and I've also worked at [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/) as a software engineer intern.

🎉 I was a [Grace Hopper Conference (GHC)](https://ghc.anitab.org/) Scholar in 2019, attended GHC again in 2020, and spoke at GHC 2021 as an undergraduate finalist in the ACM Student Research Competition!

💬 I'm currently working on research at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence with Professor [Iris Howley](http://www.cs.williams.edu/~iris/). 
* Click [here](https://catherinesyeh.github.io/bkt-balloon/) to check out an interactive applet I made about Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) that involves hot air balloons 🎈.

😎 My favorite project I've made is [DigiWeave](https://github.com/catherinesyeh/digiweave/), a programming language that generates friendship bracelet patterns. Try it out with this [demo](https://catherinesyeh.github.io/digidemo/)!
